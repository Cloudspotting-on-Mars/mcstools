MCS Spectral Response Functions (23rd May 2007).
----------------------------------------

The tables below summarize relative spectral response functions for the MCS spectral channels. These curves are derived from spectral response measurements obtained in thermal vacuum conditions using an monochromator system that fills the aperture and FOV of individual MCS detectors.

The spectral response of all 21 detectors in each channel of telescope A is represented by a single function. The telescope B spectral channels show more variability, and each detector is represented by a separate function below.

The table below gives relative spectral response functions for Channels A1 through A5. For each channel there are two columns. The first is wavelength in microns and the second is relative response.

The table below gives relative spectral response functions for Channel A6. There are two columns. The first is wavelength in microns and the second is relative response.

The three tables below give respectively the spectral response for all 21 detectors in each of channels B1, B2 and B3. The first column is wavelength and the subsequent 21 columns are relative response for each detector.
